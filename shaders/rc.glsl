/* The module to use. A module is a set of shaders used to produce
   the visualizer. The structure for a module is the following:
   
   module_name [directory]
       1.frag [file: fragment shader],
       2.frag [file: fragment shader],
       ...
       
   Shaders are loaded in numerical order, starting at '1.frag',
   continuing indefinitely. The results of each shader (except
   for the final pass) is given to the next shader in the list
   as a 2D sampler.
   
   See documentation for more details. */
