## GLava

GLava is an (in development) OpenGL audio spectrum visualizer. Its primary use case is for desktop widgets or backgrounds.

**Compiling** (after meeting the requirements)**:**

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/wacossusca34/glava
cd glava
make
./glava
```

There are currently no make rules (or configure script) for installing anywhere else on the system, and the shaders are hardcoded to be read from the current directory. When development is complete, I will finish the configure & build process.

Note: GLFW's most recent stable version is 3.2, whereas this program needs 3.3 in order to support transparency. You can
either find a more recent build or compile it yourself. Arch users can install `glfw-x11-git` from the AUR.

**Requirements:**

- X11
- PulseAudio
- GLFW (version 3.3+ needed for transparency support)
- Linux or BSD

**Additional compile time requirements:**

- glad (included as a submodule)
- python (required to generate bindings with glad)
- GCC (this program uses GNU C features)

**What needs to be done:**

- Fix breaks in audio spectrum read from the PulseAudio server (possibly a scheduling issue?)

**What is complete:**

- Core renderer
- FFT algorithm
- Programmable modules and configuration written in pure GLSL
- Preprocessor directive parsing to handle requests and transformations on uniforms before they are passed to the shader.
- Detecting if the window manager reports the currently focused window as fullscreen (and halting rendering for the duration)
- Fixed a memory corruption bug that crashed the `nvidia` driver on Linux

**What will never be done:**

- Port to Windows (???)
